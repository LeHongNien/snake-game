# Snake Game
Favourite game I played on my very first phone

## Quick-Read
1. W-A-S-D keys

2. Each apple give +1 point [My highscore is -]

3. Colide into walls or body = GAME OVER!

### Changes I plan to implement in the near future

1. Increasing speed over time

2. Customizable design for snake, food etc.

3. High-score saving system (As of now, have not learned data storing)
