# Snake Game
Favourite game I played on my very first phone

Click to play: https://lehongnien.github.io/snake-game/

## Quick-Read
1. W-A-S-D keys

2. Each apple give +1 point [My highscore is -]

3. Colide into walls or body = GAME OVER!

### Changes I plan to implement in the near future

1. Increase speed over time

2. Different difficulty modes for a challenge

3. Customizable design for snake, food etc

4. High-score saving system
